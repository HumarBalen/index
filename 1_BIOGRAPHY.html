      <h2 id="childhood"><em>Childhood Years</em></h2>
      <p> I was born on September 7, 2004, and I was given the name Humar by
          combining my parents’ names, MARissa and HUbert.<sup>1</sup> In the span of just eight months, I
          learned how to read, walk, and speak, though mostly gibberish.<sup>2</sup> My little brother was
          born in 2007, and in less than five months, he learned how to sit and eat.<sup>3</sup> I remember it
          so well—I was three, and when we visited him at the hospital, he was already big,
          sitting on the bed waiting for his meal.<sup>4</sup> I smiled at him because his face lit up when he
          saw us, especially the food my mom carried.<sup>5</sup> As a kid, I loved toys, especially toy trains,
          and I would always ask my mom to buy me some whenever she went shopping.<sup>6</sup> My
          mother told me that I would throw tantrums when she didn’t buy me what I wanted,
          but of course, I don’t remember any of that.<sup>7</sup> Unfortunately, my father was an alcoholic
          and would hurt us over small mistakes and accidents, so I spent most of my time
          playing with my toys, with my brother to cheer him up, with my cousins, and with
          random kids from our neighborhood.<sup>8</sup> I started nursery at The Arms of an Angel
          Learning Center, where I met my first best friend, Charles, and graduated at the top of
          my class, with my best friend in second place.<sup>9</sup> Then my parents enrolled me at
          Dominican School Manila, where I also graduated as valedictorian up to Grade 1.<sup>10</sup> In
          Grade 2, I noticed something—why was I studying so hard without receiving the
          validation and support I needed when my brother always received praise and rewards,
          even though I accomplished much more?<sup>11</sup> By the end of Grade 2, I lost my place, not
          even making it into the top three, and my parents were mad.<sup>12</sup> From that point on, I
          drifted away from studying and focused on having fun.<sup>13</sup> Then Grade 3 came, where I
          first met my best friend Jian and my first group of friends.<sup>14</sup> We would always have fun,
          share laughs, and play games inside the campus during break times.<sup>15</sup> It was fun, but
          finishing Grade 3 with only a bronze medal was not what my parents wanted, and I got
          shouted at and hurt by my father.<sup>16</sup> Shortly after that, I did not receive any medals for
          Grades 4 and 5, and, as expected, that did not go well for me.<sup>17</sup> The last day of school in
          Grade 6 was a turning point for me, where I started to become rebellious.<sup>18</sup> My friends
          asked me to join them to eat and play after school, so I asked my parents the day
          before if I could go, but my father refused, simply because he didn’t want me to.<sup>19</sup> Angry,
          I thought, <em>“Why can’t I ever go anywhere? Why does he never say yes to anything?
          Why does he treat us like obedient dogs who must follow his every command?”</em> The day
          came, and I sneaked out after school just to have some fun with my friends for a while.<sup>20</sup>
          When I got home, my father surprised me with a severe beating.<sup>21</sup> And I forgot to
          add—since it was the moving-up ceremony to high school, I tried to earn a medal and
          ended up getting a bronze.<sup>22</sup> As expected, they were not proud at all, and it hurt to see
          my efforts go unappreciated by my own family.<sup>23</sup> Since then, I began to change, growing
          distant from my family, disregarding my studies, and spending more time playing
          computer games.<sup>24</sup></p>

      <h2 id="highschool"><em>Highschool Years</em></h2>
      <p>My teenage years or high school days were a bit of a roller coaster—a mix of
          drama, rebellion, and love.<sup>1</sup> High school was when I just accepted that I’d get punished
          for something I did and stopped giving a fuck about it.<sup>2</sup> I would always go against my
          parents and sometimes get away with it because they noticed I was becoming very
          rebellious.<sup>3</sup> As time went on, my rebellious phase took me to a whole new level of being
          a douchebag to others, especially after my father was kicked out of our family.<sup>4</sup> My
          mother, with the help of my uncle (her brother) and my grandfather, finally had enough
          of him being drunk all the time, hurting us, making a scene in our neighborhood while
          intoxicated, and leaving her with a debt of over two million.<sup>5</sup> My friends and I would cut
          classes, be noisy and disrespectful in class, drink, and even smoke at a young age while
          in eighth grade.<sup>6</sup> We almost got into a fight between our friend group and the entire
          ninth-grade batch at the time, and we also clashed with another school, where one of
          our friends got beaten up because he went outside alone without us—of course, we
          didn’t let that go.<sup>7</sup> But I made sure the school wouldn’t call my parents’ attention by
          keeping my grades high in exams, so they had no reason to do anything about me.<sup>8</sup>
          Then, at the start of my ninth grade at Dominican, I got expelled for doing something
          illegal, a decision I deeply regretted, but it was what it was.<sup>9</sup> The school called my
          mother to inform her, and she had a meeting with the vice principal.<sup>10</sup> To save myself, I
          opened up about how much I had endured due to my parents' ignorance and treatment
          toward me.<sup>11</sup> I didn’t expect the conversation to turn into a moment full of tears, and
          after that, I became a little less rebellious, regretting my actions and making my mother
          cry in front of other people.<sup>12</sup> I transferred to a nearby school, Manila Cathedral School,
          where I made new friends and got along pretty well.<sup>13</sup> I became comfortable with the
          environment and remained a bit of a troublemaker, but at that point, I learned to
          respect others while still maintaining good grades in exams, so the teachers couldn’t do
          much about me being frequently late or absent.<sup>14</sup> It was a fast-paced year full of
          self-confusion, and then the pandemic hit.<sup>15</sup> Our batch didn’t finish the last few weeks of
          the school year due to lockdowns, but I was happy about it because I no longer had to
          go to school.<sup>16</sup> During the long summer, I got fat and did nothing but watch TikTok and
          play computer games.<sup>17</sup> Then online classes started, and I literally did nothing for the
          entire tenth grade, but everything changed in eleventh grade, I tossed a coin to see if I
          would be a STEM or ABM student and it landed on tails which means I’d be an ABM
          student and there, I would meet the person who would change my life.<sup>18</sup> I was assigned
          to a group with our class president, who threatened to remove me from our research
          group if I didn’t participate enough, so, of course, I had no choice but to do what she
          assigned me.<sup>19</sup> Eventually, we got along because I was good at paraphrasing our paper,
          and sometimes we played Valorant together (she had a crush on me).<sup>20</sup> At the time, I
          was a little snobbish, practically numb and clueless, but as time passed, her cute
          attitude, kindness, and attractive face got to me.<sup>21</sup> Before I realized it, we were still
          talking even after the school year ended and as the start of twelfth grade approached,
          and then it hit me—I NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND BEFORE.<sup>22</sup> Out of nowhere, I blurted
          out and asked if I could be her boyfriend, not realizing that I should have courted her
          first before we could be together, so I did exactly that, and the following days were
          filled with joy.<sup>23</sup> At the start of twelfth grade, we were always together and there for each
          other, and she even influenced me to study again.<sup>24</sup> I never thought I’d take studying
          seriously, but because of her, I did and even grew close to my mother again, since it
          was time to tell her I had a girlfriend.<sup>25</sup> She graduated with the highest honors, and I
          graduated with high honors in our strand (though the teachers doubted me because
          they knew I was a troublemaker).<sup>26</sup> She was also the reason I enrolled at the University
          of the East, as I had no specific university in mind, and upon learning where she was
          going, I decided to follow her and did exactly that.<sup>27</sup>

      <h2 id="college"><em>College Years</em></h2>
      <p>College came, and we really did enroll at the East; however, there was a
          problem.<sup>1</sup> I was supposed to be an accounting student, but she reasoned that she was
          afraid of being left behind if she fell short of the retention grade while I still got in, so I
          enrolled in the Information Technology program instead.<sup>2</sup> Our first year wasn’t great for
          either of us, with lots of adjustments, especially for me, since my strand was focused on
          business.<sup>3</sup> Reality hit us hard—college truly required a lot of learning, even outside the
          classroom.<sup>4</sup> New lessons kept coming up, getting harder and harder, one after another.<sup>5</sup>
          Fortunately, I got along well with my classmates, and everyone was nice to each other;
          we shared the same interests in playing online games, which helped us build strong
          friendships.<sup>6</sup> At first, programming was confusing and complicated for me, but by the
          start of the second semester, I realized it was purely logical and syntax-sensitive.<sup>7</sup>
          Having friends who help each other was incredibly beneficial, not only academically but
          also mentally and socially.<sup>8</sup> However, there was one major problem—without my
          girlfriend in the same program, I tended to be slightly lazy (super lazy).<sup>9</sup> It was honestly
          a miracle that I still moved up a year with high grades, even though I didn’t study
          enough and relied mostly on stock knowledge and teamwork!<sup>10</sup> But what really
          challenged us was the programming challenge—we were lucky in the first semester that
          it wasn’t counted as quizzes, but in the second semester of our first year, it became a
          real struggle.<sup>11</sup> They didn’t call it a programming challenge for nothing—it was extremely
          difficult, especially for freshies like us who had no prior background in the field.<sup>12</sup> What
          also hit me about college life was that every single activity, attendance, quiz, and exam
          mattered—missing even one could lower your grades, and with 7-8 subjects to manage,
          it was exhausting.<sup>13</sup> Not only did students have to submit activities, attend classes, and
          take quizzes and exams, but we also had to aim for high grades, not just passing ones.<sup>14</sup>
          That was when I truly realized that college was no joke and had never been a joke.<sup>15</sup>
          Ending the first year didn’t give students any rest; instead, it forced us to make a
          tough, life-changing choice—continue studying at the University of the East despite the
          rapidly increasing tuition fees, shift to another program, or transfer to a university with
          more reasonable fees.<sup>16</sup> Many students seriously considered changing universities and
          shifting programs, but for those of us who stayed, including me, continuing in this
          program became much harder.<sup>17</sup> The stakes were higher, and failure meant going
          bankrupt immediately.<sup>18</sup> As I enter my second year, I will try to be the most productive
          student I can be, aiming to finish my college education with high grades while also
          taking care of my mental health.<sup>19</sup> Hopefully all of us could graduate and succeed in this life.<sup>20</sup></p>
