    <p>I am Humar C. Balen.<sup>1</sup> I have a lot of skills that are useful in everyday life, sports, and other hobbies.<sup>2</sup> The most important skills that I have is that I have the Critical Thinking skill.<sup>3</sup> This helps me make decisions, analyze informations, and solve problems in both life and academics.<sup>4</sup> Because of my Critical Thinking skill, I have a sharp Problem Solving skill.<sup>5</sup> With this combo like the critical thinking, I add a massive boost to solving problems by easily determining its source and always finding an efficient way to deal with my problem.<sup>6</sup> Also because of my current program, Information Technology, I have developed Computer Literacy and it is constantly improving as time goes by.<sup>7</sup> Being surrounded and working on computers everyday easily helps me improve this skill a lot.<sup>8</sup> Because of this, I also developed my Computer Skills especially in programming particulary coding.<sup>9</sup> But the downside is, I suck at designing.<sup>10</sup> The one skill that I would pridefully boast is my Adaptability.<sup>11</sup> I wouldn't have gotten far wihtout it, because of this skill I have learned everything that I want to know at a super fast pace.<sup>12</sup> Especially when it comes to sports.<sup>13</sup> Just by watching it for just 2 times, I would easily pick up how to play a certain sport.<sup>14</sup> Like that time when I tried baseball with my girlfriend in an arcade, she said she palys softball when she was in highschool.<sup>15</sup> She straight up challenged me by checking who has the most powerful and accurate throw towards the target, I didn't even know how to play baseball.<sup>16</sup> In that moment I let her go first so that I could watch how to throw a baseball properly.<sup>17</sup> When it was my turn we were both in shock as I have executed a strong proper throw, with a proper form, with an accurate throw at the bullseye.<sup>18</sup> Because of that I became really confident about my Adaptability skill, like super confident.<sup>19</sup> But at the end I lost because that is my girlfriend, she will always automatically win at any game.<sup>20</sup></p>

    <h2 id="hobbies"><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
    <p>I have tons of hobbies that I do everyday especially when I am bored.<sup>1</sup> Starting with my favorite hobby, playing sports particularly in basketball and currently volleyball.<sup>2</sup> I was young when I started to play basketball so if there is a sport that I really want to play when I have spare time to kill, It will always be basketball.<sup>3</sup> Now what I mostly do everyday is play A LOT of computer games and cellphone games.<sup>4</sup> I literally play with my computer everyday for a minimum of 5 hours everyday.<sup>5</sup> Once I take a seat at my chair, there will be no standing up immediately.<sup>6</sup> I love to play with my cellphone especially when outside to kill some time that it became my hobby to always check playstore and youtube to search for new exciting games that I would play for a week then change into another game.<sup>7</sup> Now when it comes to literally doing nothing, when I am bored playing computer and cellphone.<sup>8</sup> I actually love to read books.<sup>9</sup> My favorite is <em>"The Alchemist"</em>, when I first read it I was totally focused on finishing it because of its peak story especially at the climax and the ending where he found the treasure and learned something.<sup>10</sup> My recently developed hobby is having a ride with my motorcycle.<sup>11</sup> Since I just recently bought a motorcycle, every once in a while I enjoy having rides especially far ones with my motorcycle.<sup>12</sup> it is actually refreshing and stress relieving, just driving not minding anything just focusing on the path and the journey that I am on to reach my destination.<sup>13</sup> It's about the saying that <em>"It's about the journey"</em> that got me into this hobby and I now understand why it is a famous quote.<sup>14</sup> It is truly enjoying if you understand what the journey is all about.<sup>15</sup> Sooner or later I'd probably develop another hobby of some sort of adventurous activities.<sup>16</sup> Actually another thing is my daily workout routine.<sup>17</sup> I am still currently on my journey of becoming in my best shape my body could ever have.<sup>18</sup> Every one of my hobbies, I treasure them all.<sup>19</sup> It doesn't just gives me excitement and enjoyment, it gives me comfort and escape whenever there are problems that can be emotionally hard for me.<sup>20</sup></p>

    <h2 id="interests"><em>Interests</em></h2>
    <p>Now, my interests are somewhat weird for others but I really am interested to these certain kind of topics and ideas that could potentially lessen my laziness if I would learn more about them.<sup>1</sup> I am actually hooked about topics regarding ufos and aliens.<sup>2</sup> It has a mysterious eery vibes that interests me.<sup>3</sup> Also it is possible that it is actually real because the universe is so big that it's not possible that other intelligent life forms are inhabiting on a somewhere super far planet.<sup>4</sup> The only thing stopping us from meeting one of them is the distance and time as we humans have short life span and we have not yet reached light speed to travel across the galaxies to search for life.<sup>5</sup> Speaking of existence, I am also interested at the Mesozoic era, yes, the existence of dinosaurs.<sup>6</sup> Now this one is real and it is very interesting to see what they really look like.<sup>7</sup> How tall, menacing, and amazing those creatures would look like if they were still around.<sup>8</sup> My favorite period of the Mesozoic era is the Cretaceous period, it was the period that both Giganotosaurus and Tyrannosaurus Rex.<sup>9</sup>
    I am also interested in ancient civilizations, it's a great mystery to uncover the secrets of civilizations, how they lived, fought, and govern.<sup>10</sup> And speaking of ancient civilization, I am super interested with the heroes in different civilizations, mythology, legends, and probably gods from different religions.<sup>11</sup> My personal would be Gilgamesh from the Epic of Gilgamesh, he was most likely to be a real king of Uruk in the 26th century BCE whom was probably mythologized after his death granting him divine-like status.<sup>12</sup> He is badass that's why he is my favorite.<sup>13</sup> And about the different gods from religion, I am actually interested in who is the real one.<sup>14</sup> I know that there must be an all-powerful being that created everything but the mystery on who is it is what interests me and I actually like learning about the gods more and more because of this mystery alone.<sup>15</sup> The last interest that I could share right now is how a certain law that actually helps me determine potential problems around me and be prepared for it.<sup>16</sup> I am not talking about government laws, I am talking about Murphy's law by Mr. Edward Aloysius Murphy Jr. stating "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong".<sup>17</sup> A simple phrase containing a powerful and thrilling message.<sup>18</sup> It helped me always prepare for bad to worst case scenarios.<sup>19</sup> These interest of mine could literally keep me stay awake for a whole night if there was an article of video containing about the possible answers about these mysteries.<sup>20</sup></p>
